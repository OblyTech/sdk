# Obly

**On-chain data translated into behavioral signals.**

Obly turns raw blockchain activity into actionable behavioral intelligence — revealing how wallets, traders, and entities *actually move* through patterns of timing, repetition, and interaction.

Instead of just tracking transactions, Obly decodes behavior.

> Patterns expose intent. Timing reveals strategy. Repetition uncovers identity.

## 🔍 What is Obly?

Obly is a behavioral analytics engine for on-chain data. It transforms transaction histories into high-signal behavioral fingerprints that expose how actors operate across time, chains, and protocols.

Obly helps you:

* Detect coordinated behavior
* Identify smart money patterns
* Track trader habits
* Profile wallets by behavior (not just balances)
* Discover hidden relationships between actors

## 🧠 Core Concept

Traditional on-chain tools focus on:

* Balances
* Transfers
* Labels
* Static wallet views

Obly focuses on:

* **Timing patterns**
* **Repetition cycles**
* **Behavioral signatures**
* **Interaction graphs**
* **Operational rhythms**

This reveals *how* actors think and move — not just what they hold.
